# Grassmann-BTRG

A sample implementation of the bond-weighted tensor renormalization group (BTRG) for lattice fermions.

The two-dimensional single-flavor Gross-Neveu-Wilson model at finite density is provided as a specific example.

## Note

You can specify the parameters (both for the model and the BTRG) from the command line by executing the file named "GBTRG".
